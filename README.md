# classicDodger
 
My submission for TweetTweet jam 4 where the goal is to code a game with 560 characters or less. 
It's a simple copter/dodger game. Platforms get wider and the cave gets smaller as the game unfolds. 
Made using the p5j.js library. The game code can be found in js/script.js and contains 556 characters.
